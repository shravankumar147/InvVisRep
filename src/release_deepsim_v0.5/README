=== Reconstructing with pre-trained models === 

You will need a working caffe installation with python interface to run this code. You will also need numpy and scipy. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

Run:

cd trained_models
./download_models.sh
python demo.py fc6

This will produce a file reconstructions_fc6.png with reconstructions of multiple transformed versions of the cat image from CaffeNet fc6 features.
Instead of ./download_models.sh you can manually download the models you need using the urls from download_models.sh .
The script runs on cpu by default, but you can change it to gpu in the script.

=== Training new models ===

-- Custom caffe version --

You will need to compile our modified caffe version to train your own models.
This can be done by:

git clone https://github.com/dosovits/caffe-fr-chairs.git
cd caffe-fr-chairs
git checkout deepsim
# make a Makefile.config file, possibly based on the Makefile.config.example
make all pycaffe -j8

-- Training --

When caffe is installed and visible to python, go to the training example:

cd training/fc6

Here you need to adjust data.prototxt to produce 256x256 mean-subtracted images. We trained on ILSVRC-2012 training set, resized to 256x256, in LMDB format.
Then training can be initiated with:

python train.py
